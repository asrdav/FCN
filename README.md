Improved TCP congestion control algorithms for HTTP/2
In this experiment, we evaluate the performance of TCP CUBIC under high packet loss. CUBIC, an enhanced version of BIC, is the default TCP variant in Linux environment and is widely used in modern web servers today. TCP Reno is another popular congestion control algorithm. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of above mentioned two algorithms with HTTP/2 (SPDY) under packet loss, delay and other bad network conditions and attempt to improve their performance by modifying the congestion window back off behavior. In the new variants, the congestion window back-off is not as aggressive as it is in the original version. This allows the algorithms to work well with HTTP/2 under poor network conditions. We also evaluate RTT fairness for TCP CUBIC and perform sensitivity analysis for TCP Reno.
